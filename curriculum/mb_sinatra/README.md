# A Basic Web App

For today, you should feel free to play around with this however you want.

You should know some HTML/CSS, so here are some ideas:

1. Modify the '/users/:id' to display a specific user's information in more detail
2. Add news pages of your choosing (how?)
3. Add the ability to create, delete, or update users (this is hard)
4. Anything else!
